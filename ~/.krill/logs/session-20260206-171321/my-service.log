[2026-02-06 17:13:24.896] Hello from Docker!
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.896] This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.897] 
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.897] To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.897]  1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.897]  2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.897]     (arm64v8)
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.897]  3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.898]     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.898]  4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.898]     to your terminal.
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.898] 
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.898] To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.898]  $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
[2026-02-06 17:13:24.898]
